Come up with a comprehensive and intricate instruction that demands the creation of an advanced JSON structure for documenting bank account management processes, incorporating nuanced details such as conditional logic based on customer age groups (e.g., under 18 years old), tiered interest rates depending on balance thresholds ($0-$999 is 'Low', $1,000-$4,999 is 'Medium', and over $5,000 is 'High'), specific security protocols for different account types (checking vs. savings), a multi-step verification process involving at least three distinct steps before fund transfers can occur, an escalation pathway in case of discrepancies or disputes during transactions that includes customer support contact information and expected resolution times based on the severity of issues reported, as well as integrating external data sources such as real-time exchange rates for international wire transfer processing. The document must also include a dynamic adjustment system where interest rate changes are reflected in account statements with at least two examples demonstrating this functionality using pseudocode or JSON schema definitions within your instructions to ensure clarity and precision, while maintaining strict adherence to the latest GDPR compliance regulations for personal data handling.
