# DMN Decision Tables
This directory contains DMN (Decision Model and Notation) files for business rules and decision tables.

## File naming convention
DMN files should match the BusinessRuleTask names from BPMN files:
- pre-screen-party.dmn
- evaluate-credit-policies.dmn
- assess-risk.dmn

The system will automatically match BusinessRuleTask names to DMN files.
